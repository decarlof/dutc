# NOTE: for naming & design purposes, you may assume the players are directional
#       i.e., `a` is the Player
#             `b` is the Challenger
#       e.g., `rules` could return "player wins" or "player loses"
#              or it could "player wins" vs "challenger wins"
# QUESTION: how do you represent ties?
